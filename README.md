# sweet-shell

This is a wrapper npm package called `sweet.js` around the npm
packages [`@sweet-js/cli`](https://github.com/sweet-js/sweet-cli) 
and [`@sweet-js/core`](https://github.com/sweet-js/sweet-core). 
It is deprecated; you should probably use either the cli or the core package depending on if you want to use the Sweet
command line app or integrate the Sweet compiler as a library.

This package will keep upto date with its wrapped packages for the lifetime of the current major version (v3.x.x).
We will stop updating this package after the next major version bump.
